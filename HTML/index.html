    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Philosophy_of_Money">
        Simmel believed people created value by making objects, 
        then separating themselves from those objects and then trying
        to overcome that distance. He found that objects that were
        too close were not considered valuable and objects that were 
        too far away for people to obtain were also not considered valuable. 
        What was also considered in determining value was the scarcity, time, 
        sacrifice, and difficulties involved in getting objects.
